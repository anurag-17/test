      <h2>Our Services</h2>
      <p>
      Wakacast is an online marketplace where talent and casting Professionals connect directly about jobs and auditions in the entertainment industry.

      <br/><br />Wakacast is not an agency and does not represent talent or advertisers.

      <br/><br />Wakacast operates a website that provides a service enabling advertisers such as television production companies, advertising agencies, theatres, event promotion companies and other advertisers operating in the entertainment industry to place classified advertisements. Advertisers may choose to place advertisements, and applicants such as models, actors, dancers, photographers, musicians and other individuals may choose to apply to such advertisements, at which point the applicant’s details will be forwarded to the advertiser or displayed further application instructions. This Service (or a more limited version of it) may also be accessed through the Wakacast App.
      </p>

      <h2> Wakacast profile and membership</h2>
      <p>
      Advertisements may be linked to a microsite created and hosted by Wakacast to also accept applications. Such microsites will be offered at Wakacast discretion.

      <br/><br />Members who choose to subscribe to Membership of Wakacast will appear in the Talent Directory, can contact and receive contact from other members of Wakacast, and access further features and tools.

      <br/><br />By default, a Member’s profile is public, and any internet user visiting Wakacast may view that member’s profile, including photos and show reels. Profiles are also accessible from search engines such as Google.
  
      <br/><br />Members may also purchase Credits on the Website. These Credits allow Members to contact other Members.

      <br/><br />Wakacast is not responsible for the content and makes no warranty as to the accuracy of the advertisements. Members should always use their judgement in deciding whether or not to apply for any of the roles advertised on Wakacast.

      <br/><br />We provide Wakacast only to provide listings for casting, auditions, and at our discretion, general jobs, with third party Advertisers. Whether these roles are listed by the Advertiser or listed by a Wakacast representative on behalf of the Advertiser, we shall not be liable under any circumstances for the actions of any Advertiser of any role or other job featured on Wakacast.

      <br/><br />Wakacast is not responsible for the content and makes no warranty as to the accuracy of Members’ personal information or the personal information of any close contact made available by a Member.

We shall not be liable under any circumstances for the actions of any Member or any close contact of a Member.

      <br/><br /> By submitting a listing for placement on Waka Cast you consent to the use of your name, website, email, logo and listing information in marketing and promotional activities conducted by Wakacast.

      <br/><br /> Wakacast Services are limited to providing advertisers with access to information about applicants seeking work in the entertainment business and to providing access to information about advertisers to such applicants. This Service is the only work finding Service provided by Wakacast and Wakacast is not connected to the advertisers or applicants save in respect of these Terms of Use.

      <br/><br /> You acknowledge that the decision to apply for or audition for jobs rests with users and advertisers who use Wakacast, and the availability of such jobs is affected by the industry as a whole.

   <h2>Subscriptions – Charges on your billing account</h2>

   <br/><br />The fees payable in respect of the Service, Contact Credits, Notice Board entries and/or Enhanced Listings shall be those fees as set out on the Website from time to time. We reserve the right to vary the fees by these Terms of Use.
   </p>

   <h2>Billing agents: If you choose to make a payment to Wakacast</h2>
   <p>
   Wakacast bills you through an online account (your “Billing Account”) for use of the Website, App and Service. Wakacast does this either directly as the merchant or through one of its billing agents including Retail and Commercial Banking entities (local and international), or other designated authorized payment platforms/merchants (i.e. the “Billing Agents”).

   <br/><br />The services provided by the Billing Agents to Wakacast are administrative only and do not affect the contractual relationship between you and Wakacast. For privacy and the GDPR, all billing agents connected to our website may be considered a Data Controller wherever personal transactional data is processed.

   <br/><br />Payment method. The terms of your payment will be based on your chosen Payment Method and may be determined by your financial institution, credit card issuer or another provider. You authorize Wakacast to charge your chosen payment method and securely store your payment method so that you can continue to receive the Service and use the Website and App. If you become aware of fraudulent use of your card or it is lost or stolen, you must notify your Payment Method Provider.

   <br/><br />Where Wakacast (or its Billing Agents) are obliged as a merchant to refund payment, we will do so to meet our merchant obligations. If Wakacast (or its Billing Agents) does not receive payment from your Payment Method Provider or has to refund payment under its merchant obligations, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand. Wakacast and its Billing Agents reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.

   <br/><br />Recurring billing. Your Wakacast subscription will auto-renew and be automatically extended for successive periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the originally selected subscription rate. You accept responsibility for all recurring charges before your cancellation. To change or cancel your subscription at any time, go to your subscription page or email support@Wakacast.com

   <br/><br />Reaffirmation of authorization. Your non-termination or continued use of the Service reaffirms that Wakacast is authorized to charge your Payment Method. This does not waive Wakacast right to seek payment directly from you.

   <br/><br />Current information required. You must provide current, complete and accurate information for your Billing Account. You must promptly update any information that changes (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiry), and you must promptly notify Wakacast if your Payment Method is cancelled (e.g. for loss or theft) or if you become aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of your user name or password. Changes to such information can be made by emailing support@Wakacast.com. If you fail to provide Wakacast with any of this information, you agree that Wakacast may continue charging you for any use of Wakacast under your Billing Account unless you have cancelled your subscription for Wakacast.

   <br/><br />Billing discrepancies. Unless you notify Wakacast of any discrepancies within 60 days after they first appear on your payment statement, they will be deemed accepted by you and you release Wakacast from all liabilities and claims of loss resulting from any such error or discrepancy.

   <br/><br />Cancellation. To cancel, you must give Wakacast prior notice that you wish to cancel this payment authorization or wish to change your payment method. Such notice will not affect payments processed before Wakacast reasonably could act.

   <br/><br />To cancel your authorization or change your Payment Method, go to your subscription page or email support@Wakacast.com. If you cancel, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires and no further subscription payments will be taken. No partial or prorated refunds will be given for unused portions of your subscription term.
</p>

<h2>Price changes</h2>
<p>
We reserve the right to increase fees or introduce new prices or charges at any time.
</p>

<h2>Refunds</h2>
<p>
 You have the right to cancel your subscription with Wakacast and claim a refund of your first subscription payment within the first 30 days of your subscription. Please allow 5-7 days for your refund to be processed back to your original payment method.

 <br/><br />Refunds will not be given outside the first 30-day period or for subsequent payments; however, you can cancel your subscription at any time to prevent future renewal charges. To cancel your subscription, go to your subscription page.

 <br/><br />  If Wakacast removes your membership due to a breach of your agreement with Wakacast, no refund will be given.

 <br/><br /> Any refunds given at our discretion outside of this policy will be subject to an administration fee charged by our billing agent.
</p>

<h2>Upgrades/downgrades to membership</h2>
<p>
  You may upgrade or downgrade your subscription at any time by going to your subscription page.

  <br/><br />If you decide to downgrade your subscription mid-way through a current subscription, this will take effect on your next subscription payment. You may continue to use the benefits of your current subscription until your subscription renews at the downgraded rate.

  <br/><br /> If you decide to upgrade your subscription part-way through a current subscription, you will be charged a pro-rata payment for the upgrade based on the remaining amount of time left in your current subscription term. If the upgrade is close to your next subscription payment date (within 14 days of renewal for a 1-month membership, or 1 month of renewal for a 3 or 6-month membership), you will be charged the full amount of the upgrade, your upgrade will start immediately, and your upcoming subscription payment date and expiry date will be deferred from this day (by 1, 3 or 6 months, dependent on the length of your subscription term).

  <br/><br />Upgrades will only be refunded if you meet the criteria for a refund within the first 30 days of your initial subscription, and the full subscription is being cancelled and refunded.

  <br/><br /> No partial refunds will be given for unused portions of your subscription term, subscription upgrades or downgrades, or any other reason.
